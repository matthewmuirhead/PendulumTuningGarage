          <h3>Welcome racers, to another edition of the PTG GT Cup!</h3>
          Some of the past championships have seen some amazingly clean and fast racing.  With battles where you can barely put a piece of paper between battling cars.<br>
          <br>
          This series will consist of 4 x 1 hour races and 2 x 2 hour races.<br>
          <br>
          Start date: Sat 18th Feb 2017<br>
          Qualify Start: 9pm UK<br>
          Race Start time: 10pm UK <br>
          <br>
          <h3>Championship rules:</h3>
          <h4>Qualifying:</h4>
          1 x 15 min session will be open prior to race start.<br>
          Sim damage will be on and cars will be ghosted <br>
          Fastest clean lap is your qualifying time. <br>
          Dirty laps will also be counted but clean laps will always beat a dirty lap.<br>
          Be gentlemen, and space out to avoid being distracted/distracting other drivers. <br>

          <h4>Start procedure:</h4>

          Once the qualifying round is complete, we will then sort starting grid and lobbies. You will then be invited to your lobby and given your start position by the lobby host. <br>
          Nobody is to leave the start line until instructed to do so by the lobby host. <br>
          You are to proceed at 70 mph / 110 kph around the track in grid order, and form up in your grid slot. <br>
          REMEMBER DAMAGE IS ON, SO ANY CONTACT ON THE PARADE LAP RESULTING IN DAMAGE WILL DISADVANTAGE YOU IN THE RACE. <br>
          At a time given by the lobby host will be <span class="color-green">GO GO GO!!!</span> (e.g @ 5 min timer the race is GO)<br>

          <h4>Race:</h4>

          The race will last approximately 60 minutes, with 1-2 quick-stops dependant on need.<br>

          <h4>Race Etiquette:</h4>
          It is the responsibility of the lead cars to safely pass the back markers.  (if you find yourself being lapped just stick to the racing lane and race your own race) <br>
          Collisions are ALWAYS ON, so if you need to pull over and retire, stay well away from the track before leaving or safely drive round to the pits, so not to interfere with the other racers.   <br>

          <h4>Restrictions:</h4>

          Mandatory Builds for cars.
