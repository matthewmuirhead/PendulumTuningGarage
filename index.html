            <h3>The origin of Pendulum Tuning Group</h3>
            <p>
              Pendulum Tuning Group was started back in 2011 towards the end of Forza Motorsport 3 with PTG Daney setting the Garage up with VXR Stu.
              As the team grew PTG Coops joined the team to help out with releases , and eventually when PTG Daney left it was up to Coops to run the team.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our sole purpose back then was to concentrate on bringing cars to the community that were fairly easy to manage but coul aslo turn heads on the Leaderboards.
              We aimed to release a car every 3-4 weeks to the community.
              As time went on the PTG name started to spread throughout the Forza Motorsport world and grew into what it is today.
              Now we still aim to release a car on a monthly basis, hold competitions, host leagues and even more.
              We have plenty of very talented people in PTG, check them out on the teams section!
